# RoMA - LLM Categorial Robustness

 - The categorial robustness scores are in the `results` folder.
 - Inside the folder, there are two subfolders, `best_model` and `final_model`.
 - In each folder, you can find the `final_report` .xlsx file.
 - You can filter by the *test label* and then calculate the average robustness of each category.

Good Luck!
